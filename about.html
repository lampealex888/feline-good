        <p class="about-text">This is an app created to make you smile! Even on days when you aren’t feeling it. We’ve compiled pictures of all kinds of cute animals like cats, dogs, foxes and more, as well as some memes and jokes if you feel like getting a laugh. If you see something you like, swipe right and our carefully crafted algorithm will show you more of what you love! And if you see something you don’t like? Simply swipe left and we promise to show you less of what you don’t want. We guarantee that after a few minutes on this app, you’ll have a smile on your face!</p>
